# Grammar

This repository contains tools in the Python programming language for working with context free grammars. Specifically, it allows reading grammar from files and checking the main algorithms studied for context free grammars. 

We list below the main files of this repository:

- **grammar.py:** It contains the main class for working with context free grammars. 

- **production_rule.py:** This file corresponds to the class for production rules in context free grammars. 

- **tests.py:** It has the code for checking the methods and algorithms contained in the class of Grammar.py.

- **Grammar.ipynb:** It contains the Jupyter notebook for checking the aforementioned algorithms with context free grammars.

- **.txt files**: Each grammar to read for checking the algorithms in the Jupyther notebook can be found in a separate .txt file.
